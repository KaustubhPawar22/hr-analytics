# HR Analytics Dashboard – Workforce Insights & Attrition Trends

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world HR analytics use case by generating a synthetic employee dataset and building an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze workforce trends, demographics, and compensation patterns.

The goal is to provide HR stakeholders with both high-level summaries and detailed employee records to support data-driven decisions.

## Business Problem

- Track hiring and termination trends
- Analyze workforce composition
- Compare salaries across gender, education, and departments
- Drill down into individual employee records

---

## Dataset
Synthetic dataset of 8,950 employees generated using Python.

Features include:

- Employee demographics
- Department and job title
- Education level
- Performance rating
- Salary and adjusted salary
- Hire and termination dates
- Location (state and city)
